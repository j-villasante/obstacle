# Obstacle
A simple game where you need to avoid the bouncing balls to survive.

## Run locally
1. You need gulp installed. You can install gulp using `npm install -g gulp-cli`. You only need to do this once for each computer you work on.
2. Install all npm packages using `npm install`. This is necessary just each time a package has been added.
3. Run `gulp`. The game should be accesible on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and on [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).
